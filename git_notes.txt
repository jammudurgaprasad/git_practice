Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   git_notes.txt
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        example1.txt
        example2.txt
7.we can send staging area files to local repository through command "commit", in this process all the files in staging area will go to local repository.

git commit -m "message you want"
